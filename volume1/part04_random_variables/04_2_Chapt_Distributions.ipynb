    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the major discrete and continuous probability distributions used throughout statistics, machine learning, and probabilistic modeling. For each distribution, we examine theoretical properties (mean, variance, entropy/mode), verify them empirically via Monte Carlo sampling, and highlight practical implications such as MLE estimation, memoryless properties, and Bayesian updating. All implementations use `scipy.stats` and `numpy`, with `np.random.seed(42)` for reproducibility.\n",
